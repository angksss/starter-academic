Dr. Angela Stevens is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies (CAAS) in Brown University's School of Public Health. Broadly, her primary research program seeks to understand complex substance use as it naturally occurs. Angela's previous research has included identifying fine-grained etiological risk factors of young adult substance use (e.g., impulsivity, motives for use), with a recent focus on simultaneous use. The aim of this research is to inform mobile health interventions, such as ecological momentary interventions or just-in-time adapative interventions. 

Angela's  secondary research area involves studying psychological measurement more broadly by using cutting-edge techniques to evaluate and improve upon existing measures, with a particular focus on measurement invariance.
