However, this evidence is primarily based on studies that have examined the rela-tion between changes in impulsivity and substance involvement across the span of several years using self-report measures; thus, it is unclear if these changes are linked across shorter time intervals or extend to behavioral methods of assessment. Methods: Using prospective data from 43 participants (mean age = 35.06; 60{\%} female) enrolled in residential substance abuse treatment, the extent to which seven facets of impulsivity (i.e., question-naire-assessed delay discounting, lack of perseverance, lack of planning, negative urgency, positive urgency, sen-sation seeking, and behaviorally-assessed inhibitory control) changed across approximately 4 weeks of treatment was examined. Results: Dependent group t-tests suggested significant reductions in negative urgency and lack of planning, and significant improvements in inhibitory control. Conclusions: Findings indicate that spe-cific impulsivity facets show change across relatively short time frames and suggest nonspecific effects of residen-tial treatment on levels of impulsivity. These results inform the functional relation between facets of impulsivity and substance involvement and have implications for assessment and treatment approaches for SUDs.
