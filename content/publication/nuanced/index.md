abstract: "Simultaneous alcohol and marijuana (SAM) use is common, but it exacerbates negative consequences.
Individuals use alcohol and cannabis products in different ways and have distinct reasons for use. The present
study examines day-level effects of motives on consequences on SAM-use days, accounting for consumption, and tests whether using multiple alcohol (e.g., beer + liquor) and/or cannabis (e.g , concentrate + leaf)
products on the same day mediates these relations. College students engaging in SAM use at least once in the
past month (N = 281; Mage = 20.17) completed two bursts of 28 consecutive days of data collection. We
examined within-person effects of motives (effect-enhancement, social, offered [it was offered], coping) on number of negative consequences and on experiencing hangover, nausea, or blackout; and indirect effects via
two concurrent mediators: using multiple alcohol products and multiple cannabis products. Total effect models showed effect-enhancement motives were related to nausea, social motives to number of total consequences
and hangover, and coping motives to blackout. Effect-enhancement, social, and offered motives evinced
significant indirect effects on consequence outcomes via multiple alcohol, but not cannabis, product use.
Coping motives did not exhibit significant indirect effects, and were related to multiple cannabis, but not
alcohol, product use, although all other motives were related to both mediators. Findings support recent work demonstrating within-person relations between social motives and negative consequences on SAM-use days. Limiting the number of alcohol products consumed on SAM-use days may be beneficial, particularly for young adults using to enhance intoxication or for social reasons."
