abstract: "Given inconsistent findings regarding relations between specific types of alcohol-related protective behavioral strategy use and alcohol outcomes, the current study aimed to examine whether specific strategies vary regarding relations with alcohol consumption. Undergraduate college students (N = 162) completed measures online, including the Protective Behavioral Strategy Scale and assessment of alcohol use. A structural equation modeling framework was used to examine differential item functioning across alcohol quantity and frequency. Four items demonstrated differential item functioning (e.g., Avoid drinking games, Avoid trying to “keep up” or “out-drink” others). Findings support idiographic approaches to assessment in treatment."
